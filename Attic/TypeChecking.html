can be fooled by objects that redefine their __class__ attribute. This
is all right in Python, but it's not acceptable for something that
needs to access the C attributes of an object. It's better (as well as
faster) to use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">PyObject_IsInstance()</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">PyObject_IsSubclass()</span> C API functions. You can gain access to them with the following declarations:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><pre>cdef extern from "Python.h":<br>    int PyObject_IsInstance(object, object)<br>    int PyObject_IsSubclass(object, object)</pre></div></body></html>
